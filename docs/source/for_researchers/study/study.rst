Studies
=======

This section provides guidance for setting up and managing custom study environments using CARE.

You will find two types of documentation here:

- **Study Deployment**: A general-purpose guide for deploying a CARE instance to support basic study workflows.  
  Use this if you're setting up a basic CARE study without external components.

- **Revision Workflow Study Example**: A comprehensive example that includes advanced components such as NLP feedback, broker integration, and external GPU usage (e.g., :ref:`gpu-provider-setup`).  
  Use this if your study involves AI-generated feedback or computationally intensive models.
