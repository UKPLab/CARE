Studies
=======

This section provides guidance for setting up and managing **custom study environments** using CARE.  
A *study* in CARE is a structured workflow that guides participants through tasks such as revising a document, annotating a PDF, or responding to AI feedback.  
These studies are especially useful in research and teaching, where reproducible study sessions and detailed behavior tracking are required.

You will find two types of documentation here:

- **Study Basics**  
  An introduction to what studies are, how participants access them, and how coordinators can create and configure studies step by step.  
  Recommended for researchers who want to design and run their own studies.

- **Study Deployment**: A general-purpose guide for deploying a CARE instance to support basic study workflows.  
  Use this if you're setting up a basic CARE study without external components.

- **Revision Workflow Study Example**: A comprehensive example that includes advanced components such as NLP feedback, broker integration, and external GPU usage (e.g., :ref:`gpu-provider-setup`).  
  Use this if your study involves AI-generated feedback or computationally intensive models.
