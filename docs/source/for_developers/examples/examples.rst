Examples
===========

In this chapter we provide step-by-step examples for adding typical functionalities to CARE -- modifying both the
frontend and the backend. Checkout these examples if you want to get started really quick and want to realize
a similar feature.

.. note::

    For all of the examples we assume that you have a running building setup of CARE and are familiar with the
    general structure of the code and the provided APIs. Check the :doc:`backend <../../for_developers/backend/backend>`,
    :doc:`frontend <../../for_developers/frontend/frontend>`, and :doc:`building <../../for_developers/before_you_start>`
    chapters for details.
