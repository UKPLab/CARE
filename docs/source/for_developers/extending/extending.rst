Extending CARE
==============

In this chapter we provide you step-by-step guidelines on how to extend the CARE codebase to realize certain features.
This includes adding external services, modifying the frontend and changing the database.

.. note::

    We highly recommend checking out the :doc:`Basics <../basics/basics>` and :doc:`Advanced <../advanced/advanced>`
    chapters before you start your coding journey for CARE, because we already provide many easy-to-use components
    that only need to be plugged into your code.
