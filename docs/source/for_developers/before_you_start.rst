Before You Start
================

Before you start your development process within the CARE tool, please read this quick overview
on prerequisites and your building options.

.. note::
    If you just want to get started *real quick*, check out the `Development Build`_ section below.

Software Prerequisites
----------------------

CARE's backend is running with Node.js and is built with npm.
You will need to install them before you can start coding.
While CARE is deployed in a docker container, for development you should run the dev build locally.

You can download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
This will also install npm.

You also need Docker and docker-compose for building the various containers -- both in dev and deployment mode.
Please install them according to the official documentation:

* `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_
* `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_

If `make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ should not be installed already, we highly recommend to install it,
to be able to use the below commands for convenience.

Customizing Builds
------------------
Any commands for building components of CARE can be found in the top-most ``Makefile`` of the project.
To see a full list of available commands run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make help

Before running your first build commands, you may want to customize the environment variables for your specific needs.
The environment variables are completely managed in the ``.env`` files at the top-most directory.
For most parts, the default settings should work for you, but if you want to adapt ports and hosts these are the files to change.
Also note that the admin account and password are stored here in cleartext.

.env-files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to adapt different env-files depending on whether you build for development (``.env.dev``), for deployment
(``.env.main``), or for testing (``.env.test``).


To avoid manual sourcing of the environment files, e.g. for continuous development setups,
you can pass the ``ENV=...`` before a call to make. E.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    make ENV=test test-frontend

.. note::

    You should always change the password of the admin account, especially for deployment.
    Only run the service in a secure environment to avoid leakage of the password information from the environment files.

.. warning::

    If you make changes to these files, keep in mind that some parameters are written directly to the database
    and may need a reinitialization of the database (e.g., admin password). The database therefore loses all data!
    To reinitialize the database, run ``make clean`` followed by ``make init``.



Special Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following flags are relevant to configure the functionality of the built CARE instance and should be adapted
according to your needs.

.. list-table:: Environment Variables
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Flag
     - Meaning
   * - ``NLP_USE``
     - Set to ``true`` to connect the backend to the NLP Broker; we recommend ``false`` if you couple no NLP models.
   * - ``LOGGING_ALLOW_FRONTEND``
     - Set to ``true`` if log messages sent from a client frontend should be stored in the DB; we recommend ``true``.
   * - ``PUBLISH_DOC``
     - Set to ``1`` if your local CARE documentation should be published on your server.
   * - ``PUBLISH_API``
     - Set to ``1`` if the documentation for the CARE API should be published on your server.

.. note::

    After changes to the ``.env`` configuration files, you need to restart your server by running the build commands
    again.

Development Build
-----------------

The development build consists of two individual components -- the frontend and the backend -- which can be build
and run jointly or separately. For more advanced development, you need to understand the difference between the frontend
and backend and how they interact. See the :doc:`Architecture <../getting_started/architecture>` section for more information.
The frameworks used for each component, can be found in the :doc:`Frameworks <../for_developers/frameworks>` section.
The source code is located in the ``frontend`` and ``backend`` folder, respectively.

Check out the following build options depending on your needs.

Basic
~~~~~~
If you are not sure what kind of build you want and possibly make changes both in the frontend and
the backend, just run the basic build using the following commands in different consoles and the given order:

.. code-block:: bash

    make docker # starts the docker containers needed for development
    make init   # initializes the database
    make dev    # starts the development server (backend & frontend)

This will start the development server for the backend as well as the frontend. This also starts up
a database in a docker container and populates it with the necessary schemas.

.. note::

    When starting the application for the first time, you need to initialize the database!
    Please make sure you run ``make init`` before and also after cleaning the environment with ``make clean``!


Frontend
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the development of the frontend is not possible without starting the backend,
the frontend development must always include the backend providing the database and the logic for data processing.
Therefore, we recommend using ``make dev`` as described above.
This allows hot-loading of the elements, meaning that elements are replaced without reloading the whole page when they are changed.
Furthermore, the source code is not compressed, which allows debugging directly in the browser.

Anyway, it is possible to build the frontend in a minified code version without hot-loading:

.. code-block:: bash

    make dev-build-frontend

For more information about the frontend development, see the section `Frontend Development`_.

.. note::

    Hot-loading does not apply to the backend.
    If changes are made in the backend, the service must be stopped and ``make dev`` executed again.

.. tip::

    Another very helpful feature is the `Vue Devtools <https://devtools.vuejs.org/>`_ browser plugin supporting extended debugging.


Backend
~~~~~~~~~

In contrast, it is possible to make the development in the backend independent from the frontend.
However, it should be noted that many functions interact with each other,
so often changes in the backend also involve the need to make changes in the frontend.

For a pure backend development, the frontend must first be built with:

.. code-block:: bash

    make dev-build-frontend

After that, the backend can be started with:

.. code-block:: bash

    make dev-backend

To shorten things, both commands can also be executed with ``make dev-build`` at once.

|

Deployment Build
----------------
If you want to deploy your current CARE code, please double-check the ``.env.main`` file to make sure it meets your
needs. For a deployment build simply run the following command to create a docker container (terminating in ``_main``),
start it and detach it from your terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

    make build   # creates docker container

.. note::
    For actual deployment, we heavily recommend running an `NGINX <https://www.nginx.com/>`_ in front of the actual
    backend. See :doc:`../getting_started/installation` for more details.

You can check the status and logs of the docker containers using the standard docker CLI or
`Portainer <https://www.portainer.io/>`_. The container with the name ending in ``_server`` hosts the actual
backend.
