Plugins
=======

Plugins provide an easy way to extend the functionality while keeping compatibility over a wide range of different versions.
With defined interfaces, the basic functions can be expanded quickly and easily without having to deal with basic program parts.

If you want to build a new plugin,you can use the template plugin as a starting point.
The template plugin is located in the plugins directory.
