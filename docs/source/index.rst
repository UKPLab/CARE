Welcome to CARE!
================================

Welcome to the CARE project -- contribute towards AI-assisted collaborative reading.

This documentation covers many examples to get you started really quick -- both as a
developer contributing to the extension of CARE or as a researcher using it for your research.

The project is developed at the `UKP Lab <https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp>`_ at the `TU Darmstadt <https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp>`_ as part of the `Intertext Initiative <https://intertext.ukp-lab.de/>`_.
