Welcome to CARE!
================================

Welcome to the CARE project -- contribute towards AI-assisted collaborative reading.

This documentation covers many examples to get you started really quick -- both as a
developer contributing to the extension of CARE or as a researcher using it for their research.

.. note::

   Check out the `Socket API documentation </api>`_ of the backend, as well as the
   documentation of the NLP broker here: `|SERVICE_NLP_URL|/docs`_.
