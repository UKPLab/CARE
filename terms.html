<h3>
    Possible Benefits of the Study
</h3>
<p>
    The Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP) is developing AI-powered software tools to support reading and
    peer review of digital scientific literature. Insights from this study will guide the development of these
    tools. In particular, the knowledge and data gained will allow the tailoring of the tool to the needs of
    researchers in the humanities and social sciences.
