# CARE - Collaborative AI-Assisted Reading Environment

CARE is a collaborative reading environment that allows users to read and annotate documents together.

A demo of the latest version of the software is available under https://care.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/.

## Documentation

The documentation of the latest version is available under https://care.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/docs/.

The documentation can also be built locally by running `make doc` in the root directory of the project and is then available under `docs/build/html/index.html`.

Note: To build the documentation locally, you need to install the following dependencies:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
