## Description 

(Example: As a user of the system, after highlighting a text inside of the Annotator.vue, a pen icon should appear with which I can initiate a change of the text (edit mode).) 

## Acceptance Criteria 

(Example: The pen icon appears directly after the respective text has been annotated and disappears upon selection or a mouse click on any other area, as well as upon leaving a defined area around the icon. A mouse click on the icon starts the edit mode for the selected text.)
